# Defects list

  * Nulls are not blocked when editing an item, so I can persist an item with an empty name.
  * Duplicate item names are not blocked.
  * Allowed to rename an item using existing name.
  * I was able to create an item name consisting of multiple (many, many) spaces. When the item was persisted the spaces were escaped and the item appeared to have a blank name.
